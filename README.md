# React Interview Report

> A focused vault of React knowledge, patterns, and preparation — built for interviews, real-world mastery, and developer clarity.

This repository is dedicated to **React.js** — not just as a library, but as a mindset. It collects everything from core concepts to component patterns, lifecycle control, hooks, state management, and clean code practices.

---

## 📚 Purpose

To keep track of:
- **Interview-level questions & answers**
- **Code patterns you forget mid-project**
- **Quick-ref use cases for all major hooks**
- Component logic, useEffect behaviors, optimization patterns

This is a developer-first knowledge base — built for **speed, retention, and reuse.**
